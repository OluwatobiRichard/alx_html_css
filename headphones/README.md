# Custom Web Page Implementation

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a fully functional web page based on a design by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. The goal is to create a web page that closely matches the provided design using only HTML, CSS, and knowledge of accessibility and responsive design.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Implementing the web page without using any external libraries or frameworks.
- Applying fundamental HTML and CSS skills to create a structured and styled layout.
- Ensuring that the web page is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
- Making the web page responsive, so it looks good on devices of various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Pure HTML/CSS Implementation:** Built entirely from scratch, following best practices for clean and semantic code.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Efforts have been made to make the web page accessible to everyone, including keyboard navigation and screen reader users.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- **Pixel-Perfect Matching:** The visual design has been closely followed to match the provided Figma design as closely as possible.

## Screenshots

You can view the final design screens provided by Nicolas Philippot [here](URL_TO_FINAL_SCREENS). The implemented web page aims to replicate this design.

## Requirements

- The project must not include any external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap).
- JavaScript is not allowed; the project relies solely on HTML and CSS.
- The maximum content width is limited to 1000px for optimal readability.

## Accessibility Considerations

To ensure the web page is accessible, the following techniques have been implemented:
- Semantic HTML tags for structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Alt text for all images.
- Keyboard navigability.
- Proper color contrast ratios.
